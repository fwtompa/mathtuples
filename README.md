# Description of math token creation
Frank Tompa, January 2025
(version 2: May 2022)
(version 3: January 2025; extending to operator trees [Content MML])

As a first step to either indexing or querying, and building on the code from Tangent [1] and Tangent-3 [2], this module takes a document and converts all MathML expressions into math features. To this end, convert_math_expression() in convert.py first transforms any MathML expression to a symbol layout tree and/or an operator tree and then traverses the tree(s) recursively to extract a list of features.

After extensive experimentation, the optimal set of features was found to comprise four types [3]:
   1. Symbol pairs with window size 1 (symbols on adjacent nodes in the tree and edge label)
   2. Terminal symbols (leaves of the tree)
   3. Compound symbols (nodes with more than one outedge together with sets of outedge labels)
   4. Duplicate symbols (symbols that are repeated in the formula together with their relative paths)
   5. Expanded locations (any of the earlier features plus paths to the feature location if fewer than 8 nodes on that path)
Paths are measured from the root of the tree or from the closest relational (i.e., equality-like) operator.

For example, given the MathML equivalent of _y<sub>i</sub><sup>n</sup> = n + x<sup>n</sup>_, the extracted features are represented by the concatenation of the following string representations of math tuples:
 ```
 #(start)#
 #(v!y,=,n)# #(v!y,v!i,b)# #(v!y,v!n,a)# #(=,v!n,n)# #(v!n,+,n)# #(+,n!x)# #(v!x,v!n,a)#
 #(v!i,!0)# #(v!n,!0)# #(v!n,!0)#
 #(v!y,[a,b,n])#
 #{v!n,nna}# #{v!n,a,n}# #{?v,nna}# #{?v,a,n}# 
 #(v!y,=,n,)# #(v!y,v!i,b,)# #(v!y,v!n,a,)# #(=,v!n,n,n)# #(v!n,+,n,n)# #(+,n!x,nn)# #(v!x,v!n,a,nnn)#
 #(v!i,!0,b)# #(v!n,!0,a)# #(v!n,!0,nnna)#
 #(v!y,[a,b,n],)#
 #{v!n,nna,n}# #{v!n,a,n,}# #{?v,nna,n}# #{?v,a,n,}# 
 #(end)#
 ```
where the first token indicates the start of a formula, the tokens on the next line represent adjacent symbol pairs, the tokens on the fourth line represent terminal symbols, the one on the fifth line represents the sole compound symbol, the ones on the next line represent duplicate symbols, the ones on the next four lines represent all the previous features with their locations, and the final line signals the end of the formula.
 
Such text representing the extracted features can be used in place of each mathematical expression found in a document or query. 

Generic wildcard symbols may be included in queries, as in the query formula _?A x ?B = y_, where _?A_ and _?B_ can match anything. Wildcards are matched by expanding math tokens at the time of indexing to include their wildcard token matches (by calling convert_math_expression() with synonyms=True when indexing). For example, when a symbol pair such as `#(v!y,=,n)#` is generated at index time, two additional tokens `#(*,=,n)#` and `#(v!y,*,n)#` are also generated. Similarly, all compound symbols are also extended to include their wildcard equivalents, so `#(v!y,[a,b,n])#` causes `#(*,[a,b,n])#` to be generated as well. (To avoid excessive computation and to save index space, `#(*,*,n)#` is not generated and terminal and symbols are not expanded to their wildcard equivalents.)
